# React + Vite

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to effectively fetch and manage user data in a React application using Context API and Axios. It showcases:

Context API: A mechanism for sharing data across components without prop drilling.
Axios: A popular library for making HTTP requests to fetch data from servers.
Error Handling: Gracefully handling potential errors during data fetching.
Loading States: Indicating when data is being fetched to provide a better user experience.
JSON Server: A simple server for mocking a REST API to simulate realistic data fetching.
## Getting Started

Prerequisites:

Node.js and npm (or yarn) are installed on your system.
Installation:

Clone this repository.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Install dependencies: pnpm install
Start JSON Server:

In a separate terminal window, run: json-server --watch db.json --port 3001
Run the React Application:

In the main terminal, run: pnpm dev
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000 by default.
## Key Features

User Data Fetching: Retrieves user data from a JSON server using Axios.
Context API Implementation: Manages user data, loading state, and error state globally using Context API.
User Table Display: Renders a table showcasing fetched user information.
Error Handling: Displays appropriate error messages in case of fetching failures.
Loading State Handling: Shows a loading indicator while data is being fetched.
## File Structure

src/App.jsx: Main application component responsible for rendering user data.
src/context/user/UserContext.js: Creates a Context for user data management.
src/context/user/UserContextProvider.jsx: Wraps the application with the Context Provider, making user data accessible to child components.
src/main.jsx: Entry point of the React application.
db.json: Mock data file simulating a REST API response.
## Future Enhancements

Pagination for handling large datasets.
User filtering and sorting capabilities.
Persisting user data in local storage or a database.
Adding user authentication and authorization.
## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with Axios or the server, double-check the JSON Server setup and ensure it's running on port 3001.
For any other errors, refer to the browser console for detailed error messages.
## Additional Notes

Consider using TypeScript for enhanced type safety and code maintainability.
Explore advanced React features like hooks and custom hooks for better code organization.
Implement unit tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
